this is the odds calculator for texas hol'em poker.
It is written in clojure and currently it has only repl interface.

The main functionality is to calculate the matchups between two hold'em hands
and you can do that by calling

(use 'info.kovanovic.isildur2.get-odds)
to use the isildur2 library

After that you can call 
(get-odds "hand1" "hand2")
or
(get-odds "hand1" "hand2" "board")

to receive the odds for winning the hand.

If you call the first version 
the whole board(5 cards) will be dealt.

if you call the second version the remaining number of cards will be dealt.
So for instance lets suppose you called it something like
(get-odds "Ad As" "Qd Qs" "2h 3d 5s")
only last two cards(turn and the river) will be dealt because first three cards(flop) are already dealt.

The names of the cards are in standard poker convention so the ranks are from 2-9 T J Q K A
and the abbreviations for suits are s(spades) d(diamonds) c(clubs) h(hearts).

I hope you will enjoy it. :)
